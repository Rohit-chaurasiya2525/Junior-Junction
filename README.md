# Junior Junction
Junior Junction is a platform that connects final-year students with their juniors, allowing them to pass on essential items like bicycles, laptops, and other study-related materials. This initiative fosters a community-driven approach to resource sharing, ensuring that valuable items are reused and continue to benefit students.
